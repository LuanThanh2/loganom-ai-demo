  "reason": "**Risk:** LOW\n\n**Rationale:**  \nActivity corresponds to standard Windows Component-Based Servicing (CBS) operations loading registry hives from a Volume Shadow Copy for system maintenance. The warnings indicate manifest parsing errors during package inspection, consistent with known Windows update/corruption issues rather than malicious activity. No user/host context or suspicious process execution detected.\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Verify system integrity** - Run `sfc /scannow` to check for system file corruption\n2. **Check Windows Update history** - Review recent updates/patches that may have triggered this maintenance activity\n3. **Monitor for persistence** - Ensure no abnormal scheduled tasks or services were created during this timeframe\n\n*Note: This appears to be normal system maintenance behavior. No immediate containment required.*",
